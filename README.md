Sump Pump Monitor SmartApp. It tells you if pump has been running to long. It monitors the wattage draw from an Aeon Smart Energy Meter.
Thanks to bmmiller's smartapp.laundrymonitor.  I changed code to alert when wattage is "above" a set point for X amount of time in the Sump Pump Monitor SmartApp.
